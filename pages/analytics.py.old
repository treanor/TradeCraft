"""
Analytics/Dashboard Page for Trade Craft

This module has been refactored and split into multiple files for better maintainability.

The functionality is now organized as follows:
- analytics/layout.py: UI layout definitions (View layer)
- analytics/data_processor.py: Data processing and calculations (Model layer)
- analytics/callbacks.py: Callback logic and user interactions (ViewModel layer)
- analytics/__init__.py: Main module that ties everything together

This follows MVVM architecture pattern with proper separation of concerns.
