"""
Trade Log Page for Trade Craft

This module has been refactored and split into multiple files for better maintainability.

The functionality is now organized as follows:
- trade_log/layout.py: UI layout definitions (View layer)
- trade_log/callbacks.py: Callback logic and user interactions (ViewModel layer)
- trade_log/__init__.py: Main module that ties everything together

This follows MVVM architecture pattern with proper separation of concerns.
